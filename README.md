# localfootballers
The purpose of this is to collect the names of **local** football players, i.e. those who have nationality of the country where they currently play.  Why? Because football team squads are a great source of real names that can be used to train certain NLP based machine learning models. 

So far, the script has been confirmed working on the top two 

* Chinese
* French
* Mexican
* Japanese
* Vietnamese 

leagues.

# localfootballers
The purpose of this is to collect the names of **local** football players, i.e. those who have nationality of the country where they currently play.  Why? Because football team squads are a great source of real names that can be used to train certain NLP based machine learning models. 

So far, I have tested the script on the top two Chinese, French and Mexican leagues.
